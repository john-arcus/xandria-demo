# xandria-demo

A repo to demonstrate the [Xandria library](https://github.com/johnniewalker/xandria) in use.

## Installation

Clone this repository from Github:

Run:

~~~~
#composer update
~~~~


## Usage

Navigate your command line to the root of this project and run:

~~~~
# php ./src/bootstrap.php
~~~~

At this point you should see the 'contents' of an empty array being print_r'd to the screen.

That is all this demo does.
