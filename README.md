# xandria-demo

A repo to demonstrate the [Xandria library](https://github.com/johnniewalker/xandria) in use.

## Installation


[Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) from Github:

Then, assuming that you have installed [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), run:

~~~~
#composer update
~~~~


## Usage

Navigate your command line to the root of this project and run:

~~~~
# php ./src/bootstrap.php
~~~~

At this point you should see the 'contents' of an empty array being `print_r`'d to the screen.

That is all this demo does.
